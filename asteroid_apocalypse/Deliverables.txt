From a stationary position, pressing Joystick Right or 'd' causes the Starfighter's velocity to increase in the right direction. From a left velocity, pressing Joystick Left or 'a' again, results in no change. From a left velocity, pressing Joystick Right or 'd', causes the Starfighter's velocity to change to 0, stopping the Starfighter's movement. From a right velocity, pressing Joystick Right or 'd' again, results in no change. From a right velocity, pressing Joystick Left or 'a', causes the Starfighter's velocity to change to 0, stopping the Starfighter's movement. When the Starfighter hits either side of the screen, it stops moving.
